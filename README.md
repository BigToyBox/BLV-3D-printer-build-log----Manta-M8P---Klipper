# BLV-build---Manta-M8P---Klipper

This is a log of my BLV mgn cube 3d Printer.

I am building the the FYSETC kit with Bluerolls metal kit recommended by Ben Levi. 


This guide combines the build guides from Ben Levi, FYSETC, and David Husolo's guide on ifixit to provide a build flow that I followed to assemble my BLV printer. It's not the ONLY way to accomplish the build, it's simply a log of how I worked my way thru the build. 


My build includes the following mods:

1. Klipper firmware running on a BTT Manta M8P with a CB1 raspberry pi clone
2. Neopixels controlled by the Manta board

STL files
1. Adapter mount plate from the Duet mounting holes to the Manta M8P board
2. TPU mounting feet
3. Redesigned LED light strip diffusers
4. Redesigned LED neopixel diffusers
