# "The WASP" - a BLV CoreXY printer build with MantaM8P and Klipper

This is a log of my BLV mgn cube 3d Printer.

I am building the the FYSETC kit with Bluerolls metal kit recommended by Ben Levi. 


This guide combines the build guides from Ben Levi, FYSETC, and David Husolo's guide on [ifixit](https://www.ifixit.com/Device/BLV_MGN_Cube) to provide a build flow that I followed to assemble my BLV printer. It's not the ONLY way to accomplish the build, it's simply a log of how I worked my way thru the build.

1. Klipper firmware running on a BTT Manta M8P with a CB1 raspberry pi clone
