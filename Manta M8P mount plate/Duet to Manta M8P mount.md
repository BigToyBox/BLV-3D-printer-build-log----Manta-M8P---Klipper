## Manta M8P Mount Plate
I created a mounting plate to mount my Manta M8P in the existing Duet mounting holes. I used the three extra fans that came with the Fysetc kit and put them to good use cooling the stepper drivers.

1. Print in PLA or PETG

2. Connect to "Motor fan" port as shown in the picture. There is no configuration necessary. This fan port runs when the board is powered up.
